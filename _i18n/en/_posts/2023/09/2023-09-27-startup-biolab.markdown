# Startup BIOLAB

BIOLAB is a startup that aims to train healthcare professionals.

The idea is to develop a web application that acts as a virtual microscope, in which users can have an experience similar to that of a real laboratory, however, remotely.

The slide collection allows users to explore and study a series of samples, categorized by previous diagnosis. This way, the user can issue simulated reports in order to practice their diagnostic skills.

When completing the report, he has access to the official sample template and can compare it with his result.

## **This is a startup that is in the development phase and is looking for investors.**
