    - I started my career as a Final Artist and was quickly promoted to Creative Supervisor. During this period, I performed operational and strategic work, developing methods to integrate, automate, and perform routine tasks more efficiently. I coordinated three teams, all currently self-managed, and led Marketing projects such as brand rebranding and its new visual identity, renowned party campaigns, and institutional materials. I developed the company’s website, which has a news blog, form management, and image upload, as well as being associated with Google Analytics and integrated chat services.
    - In addition to managing the demand of the creative sector, I contributed by developing fundamental spreadsheets for the company’s financial management, checklists, service orders, and the integration of various tools such as event calendar and time bank. Upon taking over the management of the after-sales sector, I contributed by developing organizational charts, flowcharts, and diagrams of the company’s processes, allowing for the optimization of demand management and business intelligence.
    - Expanding my area of operation, I contributed to the development of important projects for the company, such as the elaboration of all Positions and Functions with the aim of formalizing the organizational structure and encouraging employees to advance in their professional careers. I created Management Dashboards using Microsoft Power BI, compiling data from spreadsheets, CRM, and web applications to generate analytical reports. I developed a Commercial Proposal Generator system to optimize value management and generate more profit. I led a large project with partner companies to study and implement improvements in the company’s processes.
